Only compact for 0.3DL because in this script there are many custom models, like Custom Textdraw at Login/Register screen, 
Custom Models for Luxville Pointblank map, Custom models for Special skins

don't ask if it can be in 0.3.7, of course you can, but you have to delete and change some scripts.

thankyou
